# üî• Vulnerability Assessment Report

## üéØ Objective
Conduct a basic vulnerability assessment based on OWASP Top 10, identify at least 2 common vulnerabilities in the provided/self-created application, and document findings with evidence and remediation recommendations.

---

# 1. Assessment Overview

- **Target**: Python web application (local project)
- **Tools Used**:
  - Bandit (Static Analysis)
  - Manual Code Review
  - Custom Security Testing (manual tests using Postman/HTTP Requests)
- **Standards Followed**:
  - [OWASP Top 10 2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/)

Assessment Date: 2025-04-28 20:58:38

# 2. Identified Vulnerabilities

## üõë Vulnerability 1: **Use of Assert Statements in Production Code**

- **Type**: Insecure Code Practices (OWASP A04:2021 - Insecure Design)
- **Description**: The application uses `assert` statements throughout the codebase. In Python, `assert` statements are stripped when code is run with optimizations (`python -O`), making them unreliable for production security checks.
- **Evidence**:
  - Bandit Report finding: `[B101:assert_used]`
  - Found in multiple locations such as `markdown_it/rules_core/linkify.py`, `pbr/tests/test_core.py`, etc.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Search for `assert` in the codebase.
  2. Run the application with optimization: `python3 -O app.py`
  3. Notice critical security checks via `assert` are skipped.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Replace all `assert` statements used for security/logical checks with explicit exception handling (`if`/`else`, `raise Exception`) mechanisms.

## üõë Vulnerability 2: **Potential Command Injection via Unsafe Subprocess Usage**

- **Type**: Injection (OWASP A03:2021 - Injection)
- **Description**: The application uses the `subprocess` module without proper security measures (i.e., missing `shell=False`). Insecure subprocess usage can allow command injection if any user input reaches these calls.
- **Evidence**:
  - Bandit Report finding: `[B605:start_process_with_a_shell]` and `[B602:subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true]`
  - Examples in `pbr/testr_command.py` and `pip/_internal/commands/configuration.py`
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Analyze subprocess calls in the code.
  2. Identify uses of `shell=True` or direct `os.system()` usage.
  3. Inject special shell characters in inputs (e.g., `; cat /etc/passwd`) during testing.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Always use `subprocess.run()` with `shell=False` and sanitized arguments.
  - Avoid direct usage of `os.system()` unless absolutely necessary.

# 3. Additional Observations

## üî• Other Medium-High Risk Findings:
- **Trojan Source Attack Potential** (Unicode control characters found) ‚Äî High risk of code obfuscation attacks.
- **Hardcoded Credentials** (low severity but still bad practice) ‚Äî Possible hardcoded `"git"` password detected.
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Risks** ‚Äî `xmlrpc.client` usage without XML parsing defenses.

These were flagged by Bandit and indicate deeper review is needed.

# 4. Recommendations for Remediation

| Area | Recommendation |
|:-----|:---------------|
| Assert Usage | Remove `assert` statements for production security checks |
| Subprocess Calls | Refactor subprocess usage to set `shell=False`, sanitize all inputs |
| Sensitive Data Handling | Remove hardcoded passwords and use environment variables or secured credential storage |
| XML Parsing | Use safe libraries like `defusedxml` for XML processing |
| General | Perform regular code security reviews and integrate static analysis tools like Bandit into CI/CD pipelines |

# 5. Evidence

| Evidence Type | File |
|:--------------|:----|
| Bandit Static Analysis Report | bandit_report.pdf |
| Security Testing and Code Review | security_testing_report.md |
| Manual Testing Results | Documented in the above reports |

Screenshots available in attachments (if required) ‚Äî based on Bandit's text-based findings.

# 6. Conclusion

This basic vulnerability assessment successfully identified two significant security risks aligned with the OWASP Top 10:
- **Insecure use of asserts**
- **Potential command injection via subprocess misuse**

Through both static and manual analysis, key areas of improvement were revealed. Implementing the recommendations provided will substantially increase the security of the codebase.
