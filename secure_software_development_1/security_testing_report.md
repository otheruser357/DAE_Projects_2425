# üõ°Ô∏è Security Code Analysis and Security Testing Full Documentation

## 1. Static Code Analysis

**Tool Used**:  
- Bandit v1.8.3 (Python Static Analysis Security Scanner)

**Command Executed**:
```bash
bandit -r .
```

**Findings Summary**:
- **Issues Found**:
  - Use of `assert` statements in production code (Low Severity, CWE-703)
  - Potential Trojan Source attack through Unicode characters (High Severity, CWE-838)
  - Use of `subprocess` module without shell safety (Low Severity, CWE-78)
  - Possible hardcoded credentials (Low Severity, CWE-259)
  - Potential XML external entity attack via `xmlrpc.client` (High Severity, CWE-20)

## 2. Manual Code Review Checklist

| ‚úÖ | Security Check | Status |
|:---|:---------------|:------|
| ‚úÖ | **Input Validation** (e.g., sanitizing user input) | Found partially implemented, no major injections |
| ‚úÖ | **SQL Injection Prevention** (use of ORM or safe queries) | No dynamic queries detected (safe) |
| ‚úÖ | **Authentication Logic Present** | Login functions correctly with proper checks |
| ‚úÖ | **Sensitive Data Handling** | No direct hardcoded API keys found, but a hardcoded user password (`git`) was flagged |
| ‚úÖ | **Error Handling and Logging** | Some try-except blocks found, but several use `try/except/pass`, which hides real errors (needs improvement) |

**Notes**:
- `try/except/pass` should be avoided because it can hide important security exceptions.
- Hardcoded passwords must be removed.

## 3. Security Testing (3 Test Cases)

| Test Type | Test Description | Test Result |
|:----------|:-----------------|:------------|
| Positive Test | Valid login credentials used | ‚úÖ Passed - Login success |
| Negative Test | SQL Injection string (`' OR '1'='1`) in login form | ‚úÖ Passed - Injection attempt blocked |
| Edge Case Test | 1000-character password entered in form | ‚úÖ Passed - System handled gracefully without crash |

**Testing Methodology**:
- Used manually crafted HTTP requests with Postman.
- Verified server responses and application behavior manually.

## 4. Conclusion

The static analysis using Bandit revealed both minor and major security concerns:
- Most issues were low severity (overuse of `assert` statements).
- Some medium-to-high severity findings were also noted:
  - Trojan Source Unicode vulnerabilities.
  - Hardcoded credentials.
  - Unsafe subprocess executions.

Security testing (positive, negative, and edge cases) showed no immediate critical failures in authentication or input handling ‚Äî however, the codebase needs tightening around exception handling and better handling of subprocess calls.
